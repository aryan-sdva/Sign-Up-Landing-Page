# Sign-Up-Landing-Page
This is a basic prototype of a landing page of any sign up page(without any CSS).

In this given page, I have put my knowledge of the basic HTML code, in which I've used:
[1]  a normal .jpeg image as the logo, adn a link address to my X(Twitter) account.
[2]The embedded <iframe> codes of a YouTube video and a couple of songs from spotify haev also been used.
[3]Radio buttons have been used to demonstrate a prototype of a tabel booking interface for a restaurant:
  *first, for the size of table required(2/4 people).
  *second, for the location of the table at the restaurant.
[4]An input type number used(as a counter) for the number of tables required.
[5]A slider range input for the supposed rating of the restaurant.
[6]Date input for the the supposed date on which the table is needed at the restaurant.
[7]Submit button for fsubmitting the details entered above.
[8]Various input fields such as:
*First Name
*Second Name

*Password
*Confirmation of the password
[9]A sign up button to complete the prototype of the sign page created.
[10]A dropdown menu for any given choices(here, few football clubs)
